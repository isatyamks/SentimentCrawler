Golden Record – knowledge graph database approach unfold discovery using Neo4j Client Background Client : Industry Type : Services : Organization Size : Problem Solution Solution Architecture Deliverables Tools used Language/techniques used Models used Skills used Databases used Contact Details Blackcoffer Insights Blackcoffer Insights Client : leading retail firm USA Industry Type : Retail Services : Retail business , consumer services Organization Size:100+ use data ingested Neo4j use nodes relationships properties determine nodes actually person . eg : Person nodes data , people might enter names different ways . main aim identify Person nodes may similar data actually person . represented perfect match nodes . single-person view referred Golden Record Till date , loaded data Neo4j created relationships score property defines match strength . created criterias determine constitutes two nodes based created ‘ perfect match ’ ‘ probable match ’ .We considered four properties criteria – full name , address , driver ’ license , passport number . relationships nodes properties scores , use perfect match probable match creation . also configured Graphlytics ( viz software ) virtual machine connects neo4j database helps vizualize nodes relationships . also worked algorithms using GDS library neo4j produce information graph , common neighbors algorithm used produce scores based node similarity higher score higher similarity . algorithms tried well since properties String format work . Resolved issues neo4j facing deleting Large set data Provided steps recover neo4j fails going OutofMemory . figured issues probable perfect match cypher queries working intended proposed solution . Neo4j Cypher Query Language common neighbors algorithm CQL Neo4j contact details : Email : ajay @ blackcoffer.com Skype : asbidyarthy WhatsApp : +91 9717367468 Telegram : @ asbidyarthy project discussions daily updates , would like use Slack , Skype , Telegram , Whatsapp ?
