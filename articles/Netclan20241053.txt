Specifically , research aims explore statistically significant change stock price trends following appointment female CEO , whether market reacts differently compared appointments male CEOs . Understanding relationship provide insights investor perceptions broader implications leadership diversity corporate performance . analyze whether appointment female CEO affected stock prices company , followed steps : 1.Define Hypotheses : – Null Hypothesis ( H0 ) : appointment female CEO effect stock prices company . – Alternative Hypothesis ( H1 ) : appointment female CEO affects stock prices company . 2.Data Collection : – Gather data stock prices company appointment female CEO . – Make sure gather data sufficient number companies ensure reliability control factors might affect stock prices . 3.Data Analysis : – Calculate average stock prices appointment female CEO . – Conduct statistical test determine significant difference two averages . – Statistical tests scenario include t-test ANOVA . 4.Interpretation : – p-value statistical test less significance level ( typically 0.05 ) , reject null hypothesis conclude appointment female CEO significant effect stock prices company . – p-value greater significance level , fail reject null hypothesis , suggesting significant effect appointment female CEO stock prices . 5.Reporting Results : – Presented findings , including statistical analysis interpretation , clear concise manner . – Discussed implications results research may warranted . implemented time-series analysis solution using various libraries . ’ architecture using Python : 1 . Data Collection : – Use libraries like Pandas , NumPy , Requests collect store historical data relevant sources . financial data , used APIs like Alpha Vantage Yahoo Finance . 2 . Data Preparation Exploration : – Utilize Pandas data manipulation exploration . includes tasks cleaning data , handling missing values , visualizing time-series data using Matplotlib Seaborn . 3 . Modelling : – Depending characteristics data , chose appropriate time-series model libraries like StatsModels Prophet ( forecasting ) . advanced models like deep learning-based approaches , might use TensorFlow PyTorch . 4 . Parameter Estimation : – Use built-in functions within chosen libraries estimate parameters selected model . example , StatsModels provides functions fitting ARIMA models . 5 . Model Evaluation : – Evaluate performance model using appropriate metrics . implemented custom evaluation functions use built-in functions libraries like scikit-learn . 6 . Forecasting : – Use fitted model make predictions future time points . time-series libraries provide functions easily forecast future values . 7 . Interpretation Visualization : – Interpret results analysis visualize forecasts along historical data using Matplotlib , Seaborn . Hypothesis testing Statistical Models Business Insights 1.Seasonality Trend Detection : – Challenge : Identifying modeling complex seasonality trends data accurately . 2.Forecasting Uncertainty : – Challenge : Providing accurate uncertainty estimates time-series forecasts crucial challenging . 1.Seasonality Trend Detection : – Solution : Utilize techniques seasonal decomposition ( e.g. , STL decomposition ) , decomposes time series seasonal , trend , residual components , making easier model component individually . Differencing also applied remove trends seasonality , making data stationary easier model . Advanced time-series models like Seasonal ARIMA ( SARIMA ) seasonal Exponential Smoothing methods capture seasonal patterns trends effectively incorporating seasonal parameters model structure . 2.Forecasting Uncertainty : – Solution : Implement probabilistic forecasting methods Bayesian inference , allows estimation probability distributions future observations . Monte Carlo simulations involve generating multiple forecast paths sampling predictive distribution , providing range possible outcomes associated probabilities . Bootstrapping another technique multiple bootstrap samples drawn historical data , forecasts generated sample , enabling calculation prediction intervals quantifying forecast uncertainty . methods help quantifying communicating uncertainty inherent time-series forecasts , aiding decision-making processes .
