Creating BI Dashboard Data Studio connecting BigQuery Creating Live Dashboard , Historical Dashboard companies . historical data companies , Linear Regression Modelling needs perform create Modelling Dashboard companies Data Studio . needs Exploratory Data Analysis companies Historical Data . Store Customer Account Report message lead phone lead daily basis , Script needs created deployed Heroku also need store Historical data companies Finally Create Data Studio Dashboard . Creating Sales Representation Dashboard two Companies involves multiple Reports blending multiple data sources Big Query . > > Module 1 : API Data Abstraction first includes generation access token refresh token scope Google AdWord API authentication connecting Google LSA API . fetching daily data JSON format particular account name based customer_id assigned API URL fetching data . Likewise generating script would Handle data generation active accounts based customer id . > > Module 2 : Data Imputation Storing Converting JSON data pandas data frame forming list data frame active accounts looping deriving certain attributes based handling missing inf values . Finally storing data Google Big Query database within respective table accounts using Bigquery API . > > Module 3 : Data Storing BigQuery Notification Automation task automate notifications sent email Basecamp data transferred database daily basis deploying script Heroku Server setting time parameters based New York time zone . > > Module 4 : Automation tools created till : i. LSA_AccountReport_daily_BigQuery tool : Automation Account Report companies daily basis . Scheduling 1:00 Los Angeles Timezone . ii . LSA_AccountReport_Historical_API tool : Storing Historical Data companies last Years till end date set . iii . Basecamp_lsa_automation : used pass lsa data message format Campfire respective companies groups store lsa data combined companies Messageboard Campfire one Automation Python Group Basecamp . iv . LSA_DateRange Tool : Used store missed data companies sets days months per need . v. LSA_MainSheet_AutoUpdation tool : Auto updation main sheet ‘ LSA Client Lead ’ Google Sheet . Daily Data fetched basis list required auto update sheet new companies entered would store information like company name , account id database name . vi .

Sales Representation Dashboard ● PyCharm ● Jupyter Notebook ● Anaconda ● Heroku ● Notepad++ ● Google Sheet API ● Google LSA API GCP ● Google BigQuery ● Sublime Text ● Brackets ● JsonViewer ● Python ● SQL project ‘ Google Adword LSA API Reports automation Google Big Query database Basecamp ’ developed software model makes project high quality , reliable cost-effective . ● Software Model : RAD ( Rapid Application Development model ) Model ● project follows RAD Model model forming loop end start , also project based prototyping without specific planning . RAD model , less attention paid planning priority given development tasks . targets developing software short span time . ● Advantages RAD Model : Changing requirements accommodated . Progress measured . Iteration time short use powerful RAD tools . Productivity fewer people short time . Reduced development time . Increases reusability components . Quick initial reviews occur . Encourages customer feedback . Integration beginning solves lot integration issues ● API Data Abstraction ● Data Mining Statistical Modelling ● Data Wrangling ● Deployment Automation ● Data Visualization ● SQL ● Machine Learning ● Python Programming including OOPs Exception Handling ● Google Firestore ( Testing Purpose ) ● Google BigQuery Google BigQuery Cloud Database 1 TB free storage used . ● Scheduling Automation Python Script . ● Data Exceptions Duplication BigQuery Tables . ● Refresh token Expiration 7 Days . ● Data Exception due Inactive companies Updation LSA Main sheet . ● Basecamp ProjectId Issue transferring Data multiple companies projects . ● Data Studio Time Series Plot data mismatch due multiple account id . ● Scheduling Automation Python Script . Python Library BlockingScheduler used Timezone variable ‘ TZ ’ set Los Angeles Heroku ● Data Exceptions Duplication BigQuery Tables . Structuring SQL Query deal database issues used BigQuery solve issues . ● Refresh token Expiration 7 Days . Initially ‘ Auth Playground ’ used generating Refresh token getting expired every 7 Days last longer year using refresh token generated using Python script proper token endpoints many headers defined generating refresh token . ● Data Exception due Inactive companies Updation LSA Main sheet . Data Exception occurred API data abstraction companies solved adding nested try except statements understanding issues also ‘ LSA Clients Lead ’ main sheet updated members due missed data companies solved creating script automatically update mainsheet error occurred . ● Basecamp ProjectId Issue transferring Data multiple companies projects . issue solved creating Basecamp Main sheet data fetched mapping account id fetched data using LSA Main sheet project id basecamp companies . ● Data Studio Time Series Plot data mismatch due multiple account id . Solved adding many parameters like setting metrics summation companies particular day account id .
