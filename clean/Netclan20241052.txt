Code Review Checklist Client:A leading Tech firm USA Industry Type:IT Products & Services:IT Consulting, Support, Development Organization Size:300+ create dashboard visualizes log files Kibanna Organizations generate massive volumes log files systems applications, crucial information system performance, errors, security events, user activities. However, manually analyzing log files time-consuming inefficient, attempting identify patterns, anomalies, potential issues real time. challenge create centralized dashboard Kibana efficiently visualize log files, enabling users monitor system health, detect anomalies, analyze logs quickly. solution support real-time data updates, offer customizable visualizations, provide users ability filter drill specific log events enhance operational visibility decision-making. 1.Export Log Data: – Export log data Kibana logging system file format Python read. Common formats include CSV, JSON, plain text. 2.Load Log File Python Script: – Python’s file handling capabilities read log file script. 3.Extract Error Codes Regular Expressions: – regular expressions extract error codes log entry. Define pattern matches format error codes. example. 4.Count Log Codes: – Count occurrences error code Python’s collections. Counter similar method. 5.Export Processed Data Kibana: – Export processed data (error codes counts) format Kibana ingest. exported data Elasticsearch directly Elasticsearch Python client, save file (e.g., CSV) import Kibana manually. 6.Visualize Data Kibana: – data Kibana, create visualizations (e.g., bar charts, pie charts) based error code counts. create dashboards combine multiple visualizations monitor error trends time. Here’s solution architecture workflow: 1. Log Data Export: – Log data exported Kibana logging system file format CSV, JSON, plain text. 2.Python Script Execution: – Python script executed process exported log data. 3.Data Processing Python: – Python script reads log file extracts error codes regular expressions. – Error codes counted determine frequency. 4.Export Processed Data: – processed data (error codes counts) exported format suitable ingestion Kibana. 6.Ingestion Kibana: – processed data ingested Kibana. directly Elasticsearch (the backend datastore Kibana) Elasticsearch Python client importing data Kibana manually. 7.Visualization Kibana: – Kibana, ingested data create visualizations bar charts, pie charts, suitable visualization represent count log error codes. – Dashboards created combine multiple visualizations provide comprehensive view log error trends time. Kibana Dashboard 1.Data Preprocessing: – Challenge: Log data arrives unstructured semi-structured formats, requiring preprocessing steps data cleaning, parsing, normalization. Inconsistencies log formats systems complicate preprocessing efforts. 2.Tool Integration: – Challenge: Integrating tools technologies tech stack seamlessly challenging. example, connecting Python scripts responsible log data processing Elasticsearch data ingestion Kibana requires careful configuration compatibility considerations. 1.Data Preprocessing: – Solution: Develop robust preprocessing pipelines tools Python’s `pandas` library scripting languages clean parse log data. Implement techniques regular expressions extract relevant information log entries. Utilize data wrangling techniques handle inconsistencies outliers effectively. 2.Tool Integration: – Solution: Utilize APIs, SDKs, libraries provided tools facilitate integration. Ensure compatibility components tech stack adhering supported versions protocols. Leverage middleware solutions data integration platforms streamline communication data flow disparate systems. Regularly test validate integrations identify address compatibility issues proactively.
