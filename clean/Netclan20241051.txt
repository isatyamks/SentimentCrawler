Render charts, graphs, visualizations based data fetched Flask API. – **User Interaction**: Implement user interaction features dropdowns, filters, date pickers users customize analytics views. Handle user input update dashboard components accordingly. – **State Management**: Manage application state React’s built-in state management state management libraries Redux. track data fetched backend API, user interactions, application state changes. – **Deployment**: Deploy React.js frontend static hosting service Netlify Vercel. Build React application production configure deployment settings needed. 2. Backend (Flask API): – **Flask Application**: Create Flask application serve backend API analytics dashboard. – **API Endpoints**: Define routes Flask application handle incoming requests frontend serve processed data. Implement endpoints PDF parsing, preprocessing, formula calculation, data serving. – **PDF Parsing Pipeline**: Implement PDF parsing pipeline Flask application libraries PyPDF2, pdfplumber, Camelot. Extract data PDF documents preprocess analysis. – **Data Preprocessing**: Clean preprocess extracted data handle noise, missing values, inconsistencies. Convert extracted data structured format (e.g., pandas DataFrame) processing. – **Formula Calculation**: Implement formulas algorithms perform calculations preprocessed data. Calculate derived metrics, perform aggregations, apply statistical analyses derive insights. – **Data Serving**: Serve processed data calculated metrics frontend API endpoints. Ensure proper error handling response formatting API requests. – **Authentication Authorization**: Handle authentication authorization required. Implement user authentication mechanisms secure API endpoints. – **Deployment**: Deploy Flask API hosting service Heroku AWS. Configure server environment ensure backend API accessible internet. 3. Integration: – **API Communication**: Enable communication frontend backend making HTTP requests React components Flask API endpoints. Fetch data backend API endpoints update frontend components fetched data. – **Data Flow**: Ensure smooth data flow frontend backend, proper handling data formats, errors, exceptions. – **Error Handling**: Implement error handling mechanisms deal errors exceptions occur data fetching, processing, communication frontend backend. – **Testing Debugging**: Test integration frontend backend components ensure proper functionality identify issues bugs addressed.
