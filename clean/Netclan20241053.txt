Code Review Checklist Client:A leading research institution worldwide Industry Type:R&D Products & Services:R&D, Higher Education Organization Size:10000+ find appointment female CEO’s affected stock prices company appointment CEO significant event company, potentially influencing strategic direction, investor confidence, market performance. study seeks determine appointment female CEO measurable impact company’s stock prices. Specifically, research aims explore statistically significant change stock price trends appointment female CEO, market reacts differently compared appointments male CEOs. Understanding relationship provide insights investor perceptions broader implications leadership diversity corporate performance. analyze appointment female CEO affected stock prices company, steps: 1.Define Hypotheses: – Null Hypothesis (H0): appointment female CEO effect stock prices company. – Alternative Hypothesis (H1): appointment female CEO affects stock prices company. 2.Data Collection: – Gather data stock prices company appointment female CEO. – Make gather data sufficient number companies ensure reliability control factors affect stock prices. 3.Data Analysis: – Calculate average stock prices appointment female CEO. – Conduct statistical test determine significant difference averages. – Statistical tests scenario include t-test ANOVA. 4.Interpretation: – p-value statistical test significance level (typically 0.05), reject null hypothesis conclude appointment female CEO significant effect stock prices company. – p-value greater significance level, fail reject null hypothesis, suggesting significant effect appointment female CEO stock prices. 5.Reporting Results: – Presented findings, including statistical analysis interpretation, clear concise manner. – Discussed implications results research warranted. implemented time-series analysis solution libraries. Here’s architecture Python: 1. Data Collection: – libraries Pandas, NumPy, Requests collect store historical data relevant sources. financial data, APIs Alpha Vantage Yahoo Finance. 2. Data Preparation Exploration: – Utilize Pandas data manipulation exploration. includes tasks cleaning data, handling missing values, visualizing time-series data Matplotlib Seaborn. 3. Modelling: – Depending characteristics data, chose time-series model libraries StatsModels Prophet (for forecasting). advanced models deep learning-based approaches, TensorFlow PyTorch. 4. Parameter Estimation: – built-in functions chosen libraries estimate parameters selected model. example, StatsModels functions fitting ARIMA models. 5. Model Evaluation: – Evaluate performance model metrics. implemented custom evaluation functions built-in functions libraries scikit-learn. 6. Forecasting: – fitted model make predictions future time points. time-series libraries provide functions easily forecast future values. 7. Interpretation Visualization: – Interpret results analysis visualize forecasts historical data Matplotlib, Seaborn. Hypothesis testing Statistical Models Business Insights 1.Seasonality Trend Detection: – Challenge: Identifying modeling complex seasonality trends data accurately. 2.Forecasting Uncertainty: – Challenge: Providing accurate uncertainty estimates time-series forecasts crucial challenging. 1.Seasonality Trend Detection: – Solution: Utilize techniques seasonal decomposition (e.g., STL decomposition), decomposes time series seasonal, trend, residual components, making easier model component individually. Differencing applied remove trends seasonality, making data stationary easier model. Advanced time-series models Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) seasonal Exponential Smoothing methods capture seasonal patterns trends effectively incorporating seasonal parameters model structure. 2.Forecasting Uncertainty: – Solution: Implement probabilistic forecasting methods Bayesian inference, estimation probability distributions future observations. Monte Carlo simulations involve generating multiple forecast paths sampling predictive distribution, providing range outcomes probabilities. Bootstrapping technique multiple bootstrap samples drawn historical data, forecasts generated sample, enabling calculation prediction intervals quantifying forecast uncertainty. methods quantifying communicating uncertainty inherent time-series forecasts, aiding decision-making processes.
