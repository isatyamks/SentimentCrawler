Code Review Checklist Client:A leading financial institution USA Industry Type:Financial services & Consulting Services:Financial consultant Organization Size:100+ >To process json file stocktwits_legacy_msg_2015_10.txt (file size = 2 GB) & stocktwits_legacy_msg_2015_10.txt (file size = 3.5 GB). >To handle Nested Json files conversion merged Data Frame perform Data Structurization. >While accessing Json file JupyterNB, perform Chunking file size bigger json format avoid PC standstill. >After Data Preprocessing perform Exploratory Data Analysis Data. > Conditional Programming deal Data Transferring folder based column values. training period involved 2 live projects, project named ‘Stocktwits Data Structurization’ process huge JSON Data obtained size data 5 GB process data chunking chunk size = 20000 rows time. file nested JSON data it’s attributes abstracts data nested columns dataframe. Completed handling complex nested json formed columns abstracted nested json. Handle missing data mapping index dataset missing values attributes handled 0 substitution. task involves numerous pandas operations multiple python functions. Exploratory Data Analysis cleaned dataset finding correlation matrix plotting seaborn graphs strong correlated attributes. Worked Accessing Json Data, tree Analysis Json Sample data. File big reading applying Python Code JupyterNb, performed chunking stocktwits_legacy_messages_2015_10.txt chunk size = 20000 rows time. Similarly file. Created list chunked files Json Data & Concat files list. File Nested Json data it’s attributes abstracted data nested columns DataFrame. Completed handling complex nested json formed columns abstracted nested json. Renamed columns identification. (Eg: ‘id’ ‘entities_id’) likewise others. merging data doesn’t create issue. Completed forming Preprocessed csv file 1st json file Output2015.csv. file size > 3gb splitted file ten parts individually solved nested json parts 1st file finally concat one, handled columns arrangements removed unwanted columns finally removed dictionary representation entity_sentiments column. Completed forming Preprocessed csv file 2nd json file Output_Stocktwits_2017.csv. cleaned dataset finding correlation matrix plotting seaborn graphs strong correlated attributes. Exploratory Data Analysis cleaned dataset finding correlation matrix plotting seaborn graphs strong correlated attributes. Conditional Programming deal Data Transferring folder based column values. ● Jupyter Notebook ● Anaconda ● Notepad++ ● Sublime Text ● Brackets ● JsonViewer ● Python Programming project ‘Stocktwits Data Structurization’ developed software model makes project high quality, reliable cost effective. ● Software Model : RAD(Rapid Application Development model) Model ● project RAD Model model forming loop end start, project based prototyping specific planning. RAD model, attention paid planning priority development tasks. targets developing software short span time. ● Advantages RAD Model: Changing requirements accommodated. Progress measured. Iteration time short powerful RAD tools. Productivity fewer people short time. Reduced development time. Increases reusability components. Quick initial reviews occur. Encourages customer feedback. Integration beginning solves lot integration issues ● Data Mining ● Data Wrangling ● Data Visualization ● Python Programming including OOPs Exception Handling Databases used, data stored Google Drive Local Device. Cloud Server ● Handling Huge Data Data Cleaning ● JSON Data Serialization. ● Solving Complex Nested JSON data provided. ● Handling Huge Data Data Cleaning Solved Breaking Dataset 10 stream parts data huge read easily Jupyter NB. ● JSON Data Serialization Solved Data Chunking chunk_size=20000 means serialization data processing 20000 rows time. ● Solving Complex Nested JSON data provided. Viewed Structure part data JSON Viewer Changed data proper standard JSON Format. Reading JSON Data Performing Normalization Nested JSON data setting maximum level normalization proper orient form. Normalization remaining Unsolved Nested JSON solved Dictionary Conversions Structuring data.
